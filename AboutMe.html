		<p2><strong> My name is Brendan. I am currently working to increase my knowledge in Computer Science.
					This Summer, I am doing so by working on web design. This page I am designing is 
					a project I hope to turn into a much larger scale production when I learn more about how
					to successfully store data in back-end databases. That's all for now! </strong></p2>
